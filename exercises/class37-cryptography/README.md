## ⚠️ Important Notice for Running `encryption_decryption.py` (Ransomware Simulation Feature)

The **ransomware simulation** feature of this script performs actions that are typically flagged as malicious by antivirus software. In **Windows Defender**, this does not only block the script — it can also **automatically delete it** before you have a chance to run it.

### 🔧 To prevent this, follow these steps before running the script:

1. Open **Windows Security**.
2. Go to **Virus & threat protection**.
3. Under **Virus & threat protection settings**, click **Manage settings**.
4. Toggle **Real-time protection** to **Off**.

> ⚠️ **Warning:** Disabling real-time protection significantly reduces your system's defenses.  
> Only run this script in a **controlled, isolated environment** (such as a **virtual machine** or test lab).  
> Re-enable your protection immediately after testing.
